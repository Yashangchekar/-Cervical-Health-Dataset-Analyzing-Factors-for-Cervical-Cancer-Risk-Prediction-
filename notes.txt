This dataset is specifically curated to explore factors influencing cervical health, with a focus on cervical cancer risk. Key features such as Age, Number of sexual partners, First sexual intercourse, Num of pregnancies, Smoking habits, Hormonal Contraceptives usage, IUD presence, and other relevant factors are included. The dataset aims to uncover patterns and associations that contribute to the prediction of cervical cancer risk, with the target variable "Biopsy" indicating the presence or absence of abnormal cervical biopsy results.

Healthcare professionals and researchers can utilize this dataset to develop predictive models for cervical cancer risk assessment, enabling early detection and intervention strategies. In addition to traditional risk factors, the dataset also includes information on STDs, duration of hormonal contraceptive use, and other pertinent details related to women's reproductive health. The analysis of this dataset contributes to a better understanding of cervical health and aids in the ongoing efforts to improve screening and preventive measures for cervical cancer.
